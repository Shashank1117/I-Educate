        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education is a purposeful activity directed at achieving certain aims,
             such as transmitting knowledge or fostering skills and character traits. These aims may include the development of
              understanding, rationality, kindness, and honesty. Various researchers emphasize the role of critical thinking in
               order to distinguish education from indoctrination. Some theorists require that education results in an improvement
                of the student while others prefer a value-neutral definition of the term. In a slightly different sense,
                education may also refer, not to the process, but to the product of this process: the mental states and dispositions
                possessed by educated people. Education originated as the transmission of cultural heritage from one generation
                to the next. Today, educational goals increasingly encompass new ideas such as the liberation of learners, 
                skills needed for modern society, empathy, and complex vocational skills.</p>

        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Formal education occurs in a structured environment whose explicit purpose is
             teaching students. Usually, formal education takes place in a school environment with classrooms of multiple 
             students learning together with a trained, certified teacher of the subject. It can be subdivided into 
             various categories or levels. The International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED) was created by UNESCO
              as a statistical base to compare education systems. In 1997, it defined seven levels of education and 25 fields,
              though the fields were later separated out to form a different project. The current version ISCED 2011 has nine 
              rather than seven levels, created by dividing the tertiary pre-doctorate level into three levels. It also extended 
              the lowest level (ISCED 0) to cover a new sub-category of early childhood educational development programs, which 
              target children below the age of three years.</p>

        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education designed to support early development in preparation for participation 
            in school and society. The programmes are designed for children below the age of three. This is ISCED level 01. 
            Preschools provide education from ages approximately three to seven, depending on the country when children enter 
            primary education. The children now readily interact with their peers and the educator. These are also known 
            as nursery schools and as kindergarten, except in the US, where the term kindergarten refers to the earliest levels 
            of primary education. Kindergarten "provides a child-centred, preschool curriculum for three- to seven-year-old 
            children that aim at unfolding the child's physical, intellectual, and moral nature with balanced emphasis on each 
            of them. This is ISCED level 02.</p>
